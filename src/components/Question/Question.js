                <h2> Q1. How does React work?</h2>
                <p>ReactJS divides the UI into isolated reusable pieces of code known as components. React components work similarly to JavaScript functions as they accept arbitrary inputs called properties or props.Returned React elements determine how the UI will look at the client end.Itâ€™s possible to have as many components as necessary without cluttering code.React is not a framework. It is just a library developed by Facebook to solve some problems that we were facing earlier.</p>

                <h2> Q2. What are the differences between props & state?</h2>
                <p> <b>Props: <br /></b>
                    1. The Data is passed from one component to another. <br />
                    2. It is Immutable (cannot be modified). <br />
                    3. Props can be used with state and functional components. <br />
                    4. Props are read-only. <br />
                    <br />
                    <b>State: <br /></b>
                    1. The Data is passed within the component only. <br />
                    2. It is Mutable ( can be modified). <br />
                    3. State can be used only with the state components/class component (Before 16.0). <br />
                    4. State is both read and write.</p>
